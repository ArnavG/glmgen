- Ordering: The y,x,beta returned by trendfilter are ordered by order(x). So we cannot simply add the beta's returned by trendfilter for different components. 

- Thinning complicates the matter a bit because it reduces the number of data points. 
TODO: Use predict function to compute the fits at the original input values.

- Changed trendfilter.R: x,y,w in the output are ordered back in the input order. This is done only when thinning does not reduce the number of points.

- NOTE: There is a bug in trendfilter.R: the weights were not being order based on the order of x. Fixed.

- PROBLEM: In backfitting, the objective seems to non-monotonic over the iterations which seems wrong.

- NOTE: Centering constraint S\beta = 0 is maintained automatically if the starting \beta is centered.
